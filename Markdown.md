#What the Heck is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to write **plain text** files which can easily be **converted** into another format. Most often Markdown is converted to **HTML** to write web pages, but it's also possible to use it to create other formats such as PDF, RTF, LaTeX, and much more.

##Paragraphs and Line Breaks
<br><br><br><br><br>
`<p>` tags are automatically wrapped around paragraphs.

Use `<br />` or double spaces at the end of a line for a line break
